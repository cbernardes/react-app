# SWS WebSite - CompanySWS API
React

### Setup
Install
```
npm i
```
Test
```
npm t
```
Run
```
npm start
```

### ConsiderationsConsiderations


- The API must be runinng before the app is started
- I have sacrificed tests for the applicatio. I will may do it aftetr submitting the repo
- I did not focus on UX since it was not very clear. For example, overlaping sorting and filterig.
- Improve performance during filtering. A new request is made every time a change is made to the field.
- I have all the categories to calculate/present the snowflake, but I was not sure if this was required to be presented.
- Add a config file.
- Since this is just a presentation of the API, I kept it as simple as possible. No overegineering.
- It would be nice to implement the pagination. The API supports it.
